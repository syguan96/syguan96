### Hi Coder ðŸ‘‹
My name is Shanyan Guan. I'm a Ph.D. student of SJTU, supervised by Professor [Xiaokang Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yDEavdMAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and Professor [Yunbo Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=C8bGfr0AAAAJ&view_op=list_works). 

My research path is:  
image generation --> 3D generation --> human mesh recovery --> StyleGAN inversion --> personalized generation ---> future 

My dream is that my work can be used in some killer apps. Therefore, I join as a researcher in vivo, which is a world leading brand of innovative smartphones and accessories. I hope one day your phones will use my algorithm. :)
